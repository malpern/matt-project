I'd like to write a program that automates some work in google calendar and sheets.
I want to use python pygsheets and autocalendar libraries.

When I run the program do this:

** Create a backup **
* Create a backup of the "Sales & Sessions Completed" tab before making any modifications.
* Ensure that we keep at most one version of the backup. If a backup already exists, delete the old one before creating a new one.

Clear the "CLIENT LIST" tab and the "LAST WEEK" tab of prior data in the "Matt-data-2024-test" sheet.
If these tabs don't exist, then create them. Both tabs names should be all caps.

** Make CLIENT LIST **
* Look at the Google sheet file "Matt-data-2024-test" and the tab whose name contains "Sales & Sessions Completed" and the current year, eg "Sales & Sessions Completed 2024".

    * In this sheet, look at the "CLIENT NAME" column.
    * We want to create a list of the unique names and put them in the "CLIENT LIST" Tab. There may be existing names listed there, don't duplicate the names, only add any new ones you find.
    * Then in the column to the right, add up the number of sessions completed for each client and put that in the "SESSIONS COMPLETED" column.
    Be sure to do this before deduping the list of clients.
    * Add column heads to the "CLIENT LIST" tab: "CLIENT NAME", "SESSIONS COMPLETED". Freeze the row with the column heads so it's always visible as you scroll.
    * Make sure the results are sorted by the number of sessions completed, descending.

** Look at the prior week on the calendar **
* open my google calendar, specifically "f4lathletics@gmail.com"
* Look at the events during the prior week. I'm defining the prior week as Monday-Sunday of the week before the current week.
* For each event, look at the title and description.
* See if it contains the name of a client.
    * Consider partial matches, typos, misspellings, and only first or last names when you match.
    * Add the list of clients who Matt met with last week to a "LAST WEEK" tab in the "Matt-data-2024-test" sheet.
    * I want the client list to be deduplicated, with columns for the "CLIENT NAME", "SESSIONS COMPLETED"
* The number of sessions completed should be a running total of the number sessions completed for the client that week. eg. "1" or "2" or "3", etc.
    * Sort the list by the number of sessions completed last week descending.
    * Freeze the row with the column heads so it's always visible as you scroll.
* List the dates of the sessions Matt met with clients last week one per column, in this style. eg. "Tues 9/10". If they met twice use two columns. etc. Label the columns "Session 1", "Session 2", etc. Only add as many columns as you need. The largest number of sessions any client had last week is the number of columns you should make, not more.

** Make another tab called "SESSIONS"**
* List the folks Matt met with last week, and the date. Add a column for the time the session started formatted like this "10:30 AM". List them chronologically, one per row.

* Add a column to the right of the date on the "SESSIONS" tab. In this column check and see if you can find a matching session on the same date for this client in the "Sales & Sessions Completed" tab from last week.
 * If you find a match, write "MATCH". If not, write "NO MATCH". 

** Clean up order of the tabs **
* Make sure the order of the tabs in the "Matt-data-2024-test" sheet is:
    1. Sales & Sessions Completed (this year)
    2. LAST WEEK
    3. SESSIONS
    4. CLIENT LIST

** Add last week's unmatched sessions to the sales & sessions completed tab **
* Filter the "SESSIONS" tab for "NO MATCH"
* For each unmatched session, go through the "Sales & Sessions Completed" tab from last week from the bottom up, and find the first instance of a session with the same date.
* Insert a row in the "Sales & Sessions Completed" tab below the row with the same date. We're going to insert the unmatched session.
    * Insert columns for date, client name, "Individual", "x of x", "$XXX", "DUE???", and "MONTLY CALC??", and "NO MATCH, INSERTED".
    * After adding the row, pause the script to ask for confirmation that the client row was correctly inserted.
    * When verifying that a row was correctly inserted, if the user says no, remove the recently added row. Then apologize to the user, and ask if they want to continue adding unmatched rows from last week or quit?
* Repeat for all unmatched sessions.
