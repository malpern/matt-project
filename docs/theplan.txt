I'd like to write a program that automates some work in google calendar and sheets.
I want to use python pygsheets and autocalendar libraries.

When I run the program do this:

** Create a backup **
* Create a backup of the "Sales & Sessions Completed" tab before making any modifications.
* Delete any existing backup sheets that start with "BACKUP_Sales & Sessions Completed"
* Create a new backup with timestamp in the name (format: BACKUP_Sales & Sessions Completed YYYY_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
* Copy all data from original to backup in chunks to avoid API limits

** Clear or Create Required Tabs **
* Clear the "CLIENT LIST" tab and the "LAST WEEK" tab of prior data in the "Matt-data-2024-test" sheet.
* If these tabs don't exist, then create them. Both tab names should be all caps.

** Make CLIENT LIST **
* Look at the Google sheet file "Matt-data-2024-test" and the tab whose name contains "Sales & Sessions Completed" and the current year, eg "Sales & Sessions Completed 2024".
* In this sheet:
    * Find and extract the "CLIENT NAME" column
    * Count total sessions for each unique client name
    * Create a sorted list of unique client names with their session counts
    * Update the "CLIENT LIST" tab with:
        * Headers: "CLIENT NAME", "SESSIONS COMPLETED"
        * Sorted data (by sessions completed, descending)
        * Freeze the header row

** Process Calendar Events **
* Connect to Google Calendar (f4lathletics@gmail.com)
* Get events from previous week (Monday-Sunday of last week)
* For each event:
    * Extract date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
    * Extract time (HH:MM AM/PM format)
    * Extract client name from event title/description
    * Store as unmatched sessions

** Update LAST WEEK Tab **
* Create headers: "CLIENT NAME", "SESSIONS COMPLETED", "SESSION DATES"
* For each client from calendar events:
    * List client name
    * Show total sessions for the week
    * Format dates as "Day MM/DD" (e.g., "Tue 09/10")
    * Sort by number of sessions completed (descending)
    * Freeze the header row

** Create SESSIONS Tab **
* List all sessions chronologically with columns:
    * Client Name
    * Date
    * Time (HH:MM AM/PM format)
    * Match Status ("MATCH" or "NO MATCH" based on Sales & Sessions Completed tab)

** Add Unmatched Sessions **
* Filter SESSIONS tab for "NO MATCH" entries
* For each unmatched session:
    * Find appropriate insertion point in Sales & Sessions Completed tab (based on date)
    * Insert new row with:
        * Date (MM/DD/YYYY)
        * Client Name
        * "Individual"
        * "x of x" (placeholder for session count)
        * "$XXX" (placeholder for price)
        * "DUE???" (placeholder for payment status)
        * "MONTHLY CALC??" (placeholder)
        * "NO MATCH, INSERTED" (status indicator)
    * Show confirmation prompt:
        * 'y' - confirm and continue
        * 'n' - remove row and continue
        * 'a' - accept all remaining without prompting
        * 'q' - quit processing

** Clean up order of the tabs **
* Ensure tabs are ordered as:
    1. Sales & Sessions Completed (current year)
    2. LAST WEEK
    3. SESSIONS
    4. CLIENT LIST

** Logging **
* Log all major operations and their status
* Include informative messages for:
    * Number of clients/sessions found
    * Backup creation/deletion
    * Tab updates
    * Data processing steps

** Monthly Revenue Calculation **
 * For all the rows in the Sales & Sessions Completed tab:
    For each months data:
    * Find the last row for each month
    * Sum the "PRICE" column for each month
    * Display the total revenue for that month in column G of the last row for each month
